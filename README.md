Abstract: The project title Brain Tumor MRI Image Segmentation and Detection using image Processing is designed to detect and visualize the finer details about the brain tissues. To detect whether a tumor is developed over it.By detecting the tumor size, the stage of tumor can be determined for Benign (non- cancerous) and Malignant (cancerous) tumor. This project is divided in three different areas of operation namely: Pre-processing, Segmentation, Tumor Extraction and Area calculation. Pre-processing part comprises of noise removal and RGB to Gray conversion. The segmentation technique used in this project is K-means Clustering. The extraction part comprises of morphological operations, which uses Opening operation. At the end of operation the area of extracted tumor part is calculated.
Keywords: MRI image, Median filter, K-mean clustered, & Morphological Operation.
